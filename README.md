> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Sometimes when big things happen to you, you want to write them down or document them so that you can remember. Or maybe its the small moments that you often forget that seem important to preserve. Either way, journaling by hand can be a little strenuous and when it's late and you're tired it is frequently the first thing to go. But with JournalEasy it is not only quicker to type out your journal entry but since it's digital it is easier to access anywhere and record a quick memory, as well as your memories are backed up and saved no matter what. You can also just talk and have accurate voice to text do the hard work for you. It's a win win! 

### Design

The layout is very simple. Each entry will be minimized to a bar with the name and date showing. There's an option to sort, logout, and create a new entry. Once the "create new" button has been pressed, then an empty template will appear. This template has the option for voice to text or to just type.

### Key features

- Easy login provides access to all journal entries that are backed up on the cloud for protection.
- Online journaling gives options to journal no matter where you are and what device you are on.
- Voice to text permits users to journal while doing other small tasks.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Build the content of the site. One page to login and another to display the journal entries/fill out another entry. The text of the journal entries will all be HTML.
- **CSS** - Help the site look organized with all the journal entries, interesting but not distracting colors for table headers, buttons, etc.
- **React** - Does the actual login, does the backend call when a new journal entry is created, pulls an existing journal entry from the database, helps sort the entries by date, etc.
- **Service** - Has the functionality for the login, creating an account, and logging out. Retrieves journal entries on login, and submits a new created entry. Also will support a voice to text API (I haven't decided what service I want to go with yet).
- **DB/Login** - Stores login information as well as journal entries connected to the user that created them.
- **WebSocket** - The Websocket will make the voice to text live, so that words appear as the person speaks them and they can catch any mistakes or edits they want to make as well as making the experience smoother. I could also send a notification when a different device creates or edits an entry and help multiple devices stay synced.
